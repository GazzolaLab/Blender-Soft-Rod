# Blender-Soft-Arm-Simulation

There are two main folders in this repository:
  - Projectile Motion
  - Blender

# Projectile Motion
  - Projectile Motion: graphs the movement of an object with the projectile motion formula
  - Projectile Motion Final: Plotting projectile motion used discretized methods
  - Proejctile Motion (-ky) as gravity: Replaces gravity with a spring constant to have oscillatory motion
  - Projectile Motion (-ky - bv): Replaces gravity with -ky -bv to have damped oscialltory motion 

# Blender
  - rod_sim.py: The python script for an arm (sphere joints which are connected by cylinders) performing an osciallatory motion
  - Rod_simulation.blender: The blender animation for the arm performing the oscillatory motion
